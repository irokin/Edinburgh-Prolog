### Logic Programming
1. A programming paradigm differs from _functional_ and _imperative_ paradigms.

2. It has a _declarative_ reading. _Declarative Programming_ describes the logic of computation without expressing its control flow.

3. The inspiring idea is that:
> We ask a question to the computer, and the computer gives the answer.
